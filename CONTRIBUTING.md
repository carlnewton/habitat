# Contributing

You can contribute to Habitat in the following ways:

- Finding and reporting bugs and feature suggestions
- Contributing code to Habitat by fixing bugs or implementing features

## Bug Reports and Feature Suggestions

Bug reports and feature suggestions must use descriptive and concise titles and be submitted as [GitHub Issues]. Please
use the search function to make sure that your bug report or feature suggestion doesn't already exist before posting.

## Pull Requests

### Size and Scope

Please only submit changes which link to an existing confirmed issue.

The smaller and more narrowly focused the changes in a pull request are, the easier they will be to review and
potentially merge. If the change only makes sense in some larger context of future ongoing work, note that in the
description, but still aim to keep each distinct pull request to a "smallest viable change" chunk of work.

### Description of Changes

Unless the pull request is about refactoring code, updating dependencies or other internal tasks, assume that the
audience are not developers, but a Habitat user or administrator, and try to describe it from their perspective.

### Technical Requirements

Please ensure that your pull request passes the automated checks on the CI.
